  "description": "Telegram Media Server (TMS) is a Telegram bot that downloads streaming video and torrents (yt-dlp, aria2) and can serve them via DLNA. Install TMS from https://github.com/NikitaDmitryuk/telegram-media-server (see repo README). This skill teaches OpenClaw to control a running TMS via its REST API: add downloads by URL (video, magnet, .torrent), list downloads, delete a download, and search torrents when Prowlarr is configured. Instruction-only — no install scripts or code execution; only TMS_API_URL and TMS_API_KEY are required. Use it to manage media downloads from OpenClaw chat instead of the Telegram bot.",
